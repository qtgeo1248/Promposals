                        This website is a way for seniors who are wishing to plan a
                        promposal. It's to ensure that no two people have a promposal at the
                        same time. This website keeps track of all the school days for the
                        rest of the year until Prom and records which days are taken.

                        How do you use it?

                        In the top, you can see there is a navigation bar. Clicking on
                        "Promposals Calendar" will bring you to the main page. Here, you
                        can input your Stuyvesant email, OSIS, and the date you wish to
                        prompose to your significant other. <b>We will be checking the
                        database every so often</b> and if you input these fields incorrectly or
                        input nonsense, you will be <i>unsigned</i> up for the date.
                        <br>
                        Also, the website only shows all available dates. If someone signs up
                        for a date, the date will disappear from all the options you can choose
                        from.

                        How come some dates are missing?

                        There can be two reason:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The date is already chosen by someone else.</li>
                        <li>The date is on a weekend, a day where there's no school, or a parent teacher conference.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>
                        If all chosen dates are removed from the website, how
                        come I got an error saying someone has chosen a date I chose?

                <div class="card-body pb-0" style="display:none">
                    <p>
                        The reason is because both you and that someone went on the website at
                        around the same time, so the date is shown as available on both users.
                        The first person chooses the date first, removing it as an option, but that
                        doesn't get updates and your end because you haven't refreshed your page yet.
                        So to fix this, just refresh.

                        I would like to give credit where credit is due. Though I
                        was the one who designed the website, there were so many people
                        who helped contribute to it. The Senior Caucus helped with
                        on what went on the website, Amanda Zheng, Greg zborovsky,
                        and Grace Mao helped with teaching me the necessary softdev
                        material that was required to even start this, and Tiffany
                        Cao helped with the visual designs. This website would
                        not have possible without all these people!
